# Stock app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project gets quote data from the API from [Alpha Advantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/)

Requires .env file in for API_KEY and API_URL, would normally decouple from the repo, but since it wasn't a high security api to sign up for and for the sake of easiness to find the file. I included it proposefully in project. This I know is not best practice.
